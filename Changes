0.00007 - 28 Mar 2012
    * Fix a problem where the handle goes away on newer versions of
      AnyEvent. (rt #76115, Alex Vandiver)
    * Make sure that we have AE 6.01 for the above fix.

0.00006 - 24 Feb 2010
    * Be a bit more careful when we fire on_error
    * Don't run callback when we have been freed already

0.00005 - 24 Feb 2010
    * Fix resetting on_error handlers being ignored.
    * Now on_error/on_eof does not free the current client.
